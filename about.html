        <p class="about">
            I am Manik Sharma. 13 y/o kid who knows how to code (sometimes).<br />
            I like coding in Python a lot, but recently i'm into stuff like
            Arduino, ESP etc.<br />
            [tbh i think game engine r overrated :P they nice, and help a lot
            but they just too complicated]<br />
            [yes i realise the irony in how coding is easier then using a gui
            xD]<br />
            I also webdev (badly) [i mean this website is proof lol] and like
            music :D
