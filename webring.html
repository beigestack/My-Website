<p>you know that craze in the mid 2000s to the early 2010s when everything looked like you were meant to lick it? that craze is called frutiger aero. and i really like that craze. hopefully, so do other people. to find out, i made this: the frutiger aero webring.</p>
<br>
<h2>rules:</h2>
<br>
<p>you do not need to have any indication you like fruitiger aero at all on your site. i understand your site may look very different and you do not need to add everything you like to that site. i haven't in mine and im making this webring, aren't i?</p>
<br>
<p>but there is an important rule. only one. no hate speech or non-inclusion to any group no matter it be LGBTQ+, people of a different race, just no. that stuff is NOT appreciated here.</p>
<p>now that you've read the rules, lets move on!</p>
<br>
<h2>how to join:</h2>
<br>
<p>very simple stuff. send an email over to m4(.)sh(@)tuta(.)io with the following: </p>
