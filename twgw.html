<h1>Hello! • Hola! • Bonjour! • Ciao! • こんにちは!</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website. My name is "White Guy" Herald. I recently graduated from BigCollege with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I enjoy learning new technologies, playing piano, and spending my weekends walking in nature. I also drink a lot of coffee and enjoy casual networking events.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">My Resume</a>

<p>I am currently seeking full-time employment in the corporate technology sector. I have 2 years of experience working at MajorCorporation, where I was involved in minor scripting tasks, occasional meetings, and helping my colleagues with technical problems. I hope to expand my skillset, gain more responsibilities, and make meaningful contributions.</p>

<p>I am also actively looking for internships and mentorship opportunities. I believe that with my background and enthusiasm, I can fit into almost any corporate role and learn fast. I enjoy using productivity tools, organizing spreadsheets, sending emails, and occasionally giving presentations to my peers. I also like contributing to minor open-source projects and writing small scripts in my free time. I am proud of my punctuality and attention to detail. I drink water regularly and believe in keeping a balanced lifestyle. My friends say I am reliable and professional, though a bit too eager at times.</p>
